Wind Power Project by M/s RVL

The proposed project titled under UCR is “Wind Power Project by M/s RVL”, which is wind power
project located in Devbhumi Dwarka district in the state of Gujarat (India). The purpose of this plant
installation and power generation is for captive consumption. PP has the full ownership of the project
activity. The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being
applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

Lat/Long: 21°59'01.0"N 69°51'27.2"E

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of single Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having capacity of 2.7 MW manufactured and
suppliedby M/s. GE Renewable Energy Pvt. Ltd. respectively in district Devbhumi Dwarka of the
state of Gujarat in India. This project has been promoted by M/s Renite Vitrified LLP
The WTG under the project activity was commissioned on 08/09/2021 by Gujarat Energy
Development Agency (GEDA), Government of Gujarat, India.

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 8,278 MWh of electricity per
annum. The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive consumption by the
project proponent (PP). Wheeling agreement is signed between Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd.
(PGVCL) and PP. The project activity would be displacing equivalent quantum of grid electricity
resulting in emission reduction of 7,450 tCO2 per annum. The project activity has been helping in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources (wind energy) for
generating power which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants, which is
dominated by fossil fuel based thermal powerplants.

The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is
expected to be 7,450 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period
shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.
